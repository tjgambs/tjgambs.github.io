						Poker was more of a challenge then I expected. I thought that because I programmed a huge working Yahtzee game, Poker would be a breeze, but I was wrong. I learned a lot throughout this project. I learned the importance of organization and class structure. I didn't realize I would be the one who had to deal with how many bytes my program used or how much RAM it may eat up. This was only brought to my attention when my teacher pointed it out. It was a great learning experience. Reflecting on the beginning of the year, I cannot believe how much I have grown as a programmer.
